# Linkerd Up and Running

Welcome to Linkerd Up and Running's code repository! Here you'll find
directories corresponding to chapters in the book, with each directory having
code relevant for that chapter.

At the moment, the repository _just contains the code_ for the most part:
you'll need the book to get much out of this. Don't have a copy of the book?
Grab a copy from [O'Reilly], [Amazon], or your favorite bookseller.
