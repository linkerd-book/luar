# Linkerd Up and Running

Welcome to Linkerd Up and Running's code repository! Here you'll find
directories corresponding to chapters in the book, with each directory having
code relevant for that chapter.

At the moment, the repository _just contains the code_ for the most part:
you'll need the book to get much out of this. Don't have a copy of the book?
Check it out on the [O'Reilly learning platform], grab a copy from [Amazon] or
[eBooks], or find it at your favorite bookseller.
